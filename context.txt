SPEAKER A

We're actually going to start with our main story tonight, which concerns Ron DeSantis business, Fred Flintstone. DeSantis has been all over the news this week as he is seemingly every week. He appointed his political backers to a new Disney oversight board. He released a new book, the courage to be free. And by the way, I have a little gift for our studio audience. Look under your seats. The gift is it isn't there. You don't have to read it. You're welcome. And he also put out this eye catching video.
SPEAKER B

Florida has proved positive that we the people are not destined for failure.
SPEAKER C

The santos wins. He has made a promise, and he's making good on the promise.
SPEAKER B

Florida is leading the nation. Decline is a choice, success is attainable, and freedom is worth fighting for.
SPEAKER A

Wow, there is a lot there. But Florida's proof that we the people are not destined for failure. I don't know about that, Ron. Last year alone in Florida, a man tried to steal a crossbow by stuffing it down his pants, a woman instigated as a police chase so she could cross getting arrested off her bucket list, and a man was charged with battery for throwing a hot dog at a police officer. We the people may not be destined for failure, but a lot of individuals down there sure do seem drawn to it. This all feels like part of a coordinated rollout of Desantis's inevitable presidential campaign, because even though he hasn't yet officially announced he's running, he's already many conservatives favorite candidates. After his landslide reelection as governor last November, the New York Post proclaimed him the future, which is, you know, depressing. And he received this cringe inducing introduction from Carrie Lake.
SPEAKER C

I'll tell you what he's got. I don't know if you've heard of this, but he's got bde. Anybody know what that means? Ask your kids about it later. I call it big DeSantis energy.
SPEAKER A

Okay, that is obviously terrible. But just to be clear, if you don't know what bde is, please don't ask your kids about it later. In fact, for the sake of those kids, I'll just tell you right now. It stands for big dick energy, a kind of easy magnetic confidence. That doesn't necessarily mean you have a large penis or indeed a penis at all. It's just the energy associated. A list of those with bde would include brian Cranston, christine Baranski, the Pixar Lamp, charles Darwin, and Snoopy. Does that make sense? Please come to me and not your kids if you need any penis related slang explained in the future. And look, it is worth noting, in general, you can't predict much about a presidential race 20 months out. Previous early frontrunners, include Jeb Bush. The late Jeb Bush. I don't know, it's unclear. Howard Dean and Rudy Giuliani, who is currently wandering around central park covered in thousand island dressing and screaming about election fraud to pigeons. And DeSantis is eventually likely to have to go up against Donald Trump, which history has shown is no easy task. And while Trump initially struggled to coin a damaging nickname for DeSantis, with his first attempt being the embarrassingly weak Ron Desantimonious, he later unveiled something with a lot more punch.
SPEAKER C

According to the Times, Trump has spent weeks trying to Goade DeSantis into a fight, describing him in conversations as Meatball Ron.
SPEAKER A

Yeah, apparently he was calling him Meatball Ron. And I hate to say it, but Trump still got it. It's it's perfectly stupid, childish, and hurtful in a way that's genuinely difficult to articulate. Also, it's a pretty good name on its own. If you asked me to describe the perfect Meatball Ron, I'd say, I don't know, maybe around Little Hamster or this smiley cartoon character, little arms and legs, little mustache, maybe voiced by Chris Pratt in a straight to streaming kids movie with weirdly Christian undertones that feels vaguely anti Italian somehow. But then if you simply showed me a photo of this guy, I'd say, forget everything that I just said. That is my meatball ron right there. That is my meatball. Whatever Trump calls him in the future, the fact is Meatball Ron remains a strong contender for the Republican nomination. And while many commentators insist on framing him solely in opposition to Trump, saying things like, he's Donald Trump with a brain that doesn't seem particularly meaningful, it's like saying that new restaurant is better than this chicken pot pie that fell on the sidewalk. Sure it is, but you're not really giving me much useful information there. So, if I may quote Tom Brady's publicist while reviewing his old golf photos, let's take Trump out of the picture. And tonight, let's examine DeSantis on his own merits and look at just some of what he has done to and for the over 20 million people of Florida. Because it's sometimes less than he claims, sometimes less than his critics claim, and sometimes worse than you may know. And let's skip over his early life, the short version being he grew up in Florida, was a standout baseball player, and even got to the Little League World Series with his local team. He then went to Yale, then Harvard Law School, and subsequently joined the Navy as an attorney. Eventually, he married his wife, Casey, despite having the most bizarre dating tactic I have ever heard. According to a former classmate, DeSantis would apparently tell dates he liked Thai food, but pronounced it Thai. And if they corrected him, he would make up an excuse and leave, because, quote, he didn't want a girlfriend who corrected him. And if that is true, wow, just imagine being on that date. He's out at dinner, and out of nowhere, your date tells you that he really likes Thai foods, and you think, Wait, did he just call Thai food Thai food? I must have misheard. But then he goes on to say that he knows a great Thai food restaurant in the area, or while staring very intently at you, almost studying your reaction to as politely as you can, you say, Wait, do you mean Thai food, like from Thailand? And then suddenly his face drops and he says, sorry, I forgot I have a doctor's appointment tonight. And he leaves, leaving you both with the check and the single greatest first date disaster story of all time. Then flashing forward. In 2012, DeSantis was elected to Congress. Though while there, a former colleague says that he always had his earbuds in to keep people away. And if you're picking up on a theme of ron, DeSantis doesn't like hearing anyone's voice but his own. You're on to something. Because since becoming Florida governor, he's made shutting down dissenting voices something of a feature. Here is a campaign ad from last year in which he shows off his skill at battling the media.
SPEAKER B

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is your governor speaking today's, training evolution, dog fighting, taking on the corporate media. Number one, don't fire unless fired upon, but when they fire you fire back with overwhelming force. Does it say that in the bill? I'm asking you to tell me what's in the bill. Number two, never ever back down from a fight.
SPEAKER C

If I could complete the question, though.
SPEAKER B

So you're going to give a speech or ask a question? Number three, don't accept their narrative.
SPEAKER C

Wrong.
SPEAKER B

It's a fake narrative. I just disabused you of the narrative and you don't care about the facts.
SPEAKER A

Amazingly, until around 40 seconds ago, top Gun Maverick was my favorite movie of last year. But now, I'm sad to say, it's my least favorite movie of all time, tied with cats. And there's a brutal film. DeSantis is constantly complaining the media is taking him out of context. Although it is worth noting that in that ad, he's removing some pretty important context from the media. Take that clip where he said, are you going to give a speech or ask a question? If you look at the start of that exchange, you'll notice that only one person is doing the fighting there.
SPEAKER C

Governor, what has gone wrong with the rollout of the vaccine that we've seen? Phone lines jammed, websites crashed?
SPEAKER B

It's a lot of demand.
SPEAKER C

I mean, I think at the end of the day excuse me, you just.
SPEAKER B

Said, what has gone wrong? So I'm answering the question.
SPEAKER C

If I could complete the question, though.
SPEAKER B

So you're going to give a speech or are you going to ask a question?
SPEAKER C

With all due respect of it?
SPEAKER B

You asked the question, I'm going to answer it. No, you're giving a speech. You asked a question.
SPEAKER C

I am trying to ask you the question.
SPEAKER B

You're going to ask how many questions you get? Three. They only got one question. Why do you get three?
SPEAKER C

With all due respect, Governor, I'm just asking if I could finish my question.
SPEAKER D

You didn't.
SPEAKER B

You finished the question.
SPEAKER A

No, she didn't. And all she's asking you for is some basic accountability. When you see that in context, that's a pretty gross case of someone meet Bull Splaining to a journalist who's just trying to do a fucking job. Though to be clear, DeSantis doesn't hate all media because there is one notable exception, and it's the exact one that you are thinking of. DeSantis is on Fox News all the time, morning, noon and night. Even by Republican standards, the mutual affection between him and Fox is pretty extreme. In just one four month stretch, the network asked him to appear on its airwaves 113 times or nearly once a day, with one Fox producer even offering to let him pick the subject matter if he agreed to come on, which is just pathetic. I'll put it this way if Fox News ever went on a date with Ron DeSantis, they definitely wouldn't correct him when he called it thigh foo's. But DeSantis isn't just another Fox talking head. He sells himself as someone with a proven track record. And he has done some terrible stuff. For instance, at his urging, his state's medical board banned gender affirming care for minors, and he signed a 15 week abortion ban into law while recently suggesting he'd sign a six week one if it reached his desk. But look, lots of Republican governors have done things like that. What makes this Santis extra popular on the right is his willingness to wage big symbolic culture wars. He's bragged that he's made Florida the freest state in America while defending its residents from the greatest scourge of our time.
SPEAKER B

Woke ism is really a form of cultural Marxism. The woke ism is the new religion of the left. We are not and will never, ever surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die.
SPEAKER A

Okay, first, Florida is not where woke goes to die. It's where wealthy Upper East Side New Yorkers go to die. Get your facts, strike. But second, DeSantis says woke so often it begins to lose all meaning. But if you wonder what he thinks it actually stands for, his general counsel once helpfully defined woke in court as the view that there are systemic injustices in American society and the need to have policies that address them, which is a hell of a thing for someone to admit to everyone that you are against. DeSantis might really want to invest in a lawyer more willing to lie for him. I actually understand there's one currently wandering around Central Park who is available if you can catch him, but you'll have to be careful he's slippy. DeSantis spends a lot of energy decrying wokeness and empty virtue signaling, although he also seems to spend a huge amount of time doing the right wing version of exactly that. For instance, there was a time that he waited on in on Leah Thomas, a trans woman who'd won an event in an NCAA swimming championship. The second place finisher happened to be from Florida, which DeSantis then took as an excuse to come out and do this shit.
SPEAKER B

If you look at what the NCAA has done by allowing basically men to compete in women's athletics, in this case, the swimming you had, the number one woman who finished was from Sarasota. We're going to be doing a proclamation saying that Emma is the best female swimmer in the 500 meters freestyle because she earned that, okay?
SPEAKER A

Aside from being fucking gross and awful. To be very clear, DeSantis doesn't have the power to declare or disqualify winners in college sports, rendering that proclamation completely pointless. But since men in suits seem to be using their platforms to invalidate past athletic achievements out of pure spite, I hereby declare that by signing this Ronda Santos's Little League team, the swing in Meatballs did not, in fact, ever make the Little League World Series. Instead, his team's place will and henceforth be taken by the season six cast of RuPaul's Drag Race. I declare it, it is declared, it is done. But it's gone way beyond just empty, hateful proclamations. DeSantis has also signed a bunch of attention grabbing bills that seem designed to delight conservatives and enrage liberals. And while the announcements of these bills tend to get a lot of national media coverage, the actual implementation of them can get far less scrutiny. Take Desantis's so called anti riot law, which he passed following the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020. That law, among other things, strengthens criminal penalties for those deemed rioters at demonstrations. And he loves to brag to conservative audiences about just how mad it's made people.
SPEAKER B

And I have to say, brag a little bit. Our anti riot legislation was recently criticized by the United Nations, so I wear that as a badge of honor, okay?
SPEAKER A

Being chastised by the UN isn't innately positive. What other admonitions would fill DeSantis with a misplaced sense of pride? I was also criticized by the Holocaust Museum. Lego called me a scumbag and Malala yusufzai says she punched me in the throat if she ever got a chance. So, aware that as a badge of honor. But it is not just the UN that had a problem with that law. A judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the key part of it from being enforced, arguing that it could effectively criminalize legal protected speech, and that it was vague to the point of unconstitutionality. And the same thing happened to his Stop Social Media Censorship Act, which, again, got a huge amount of attention when he first signed it. It threatened social media platforms with fines for banning political candidates, and he proposed it shortly after a number of them had removed Trump in the wake of January 6 because of, you know, that thing. But that law is also under a preliminary injunction from a judge who at one point told the DeSantis administration's lawyers, I won't put you on the spot and ask if you've ever dealt with a statute that was more poorly drafted. And look, he is still fighting those lawsuits, and future decisions could wind up going his way. After all, these cases are coming through higher courts that range from fairly conservative all the way up to overturned Roe v. Wade. But even when DeSantis has existing laws on his side, his application of them can be slapdash and gross. Just last year, he made a big show of announcing his new elections. Crime and Security Office had spearheaded the arrest of 20 people who voted illegally. But these were largely people who the state had cleared to join the voter rolls, so they assumed they were eligible to vote, despite the fact that they technically weren't. Now, one way of dealing with that would have been to simply contact those people, explain the mistake, and remove them from the roles. But instead, what DeSantis chose to do was to send armed cops to conduct arrests with body cam video, later revealing police with guns drawn pulling people out of their houses. And if you listen to the cops involved, even they seem annoyed and embarrassed at what they're having to do. Commit no fraud.
SPEAKER B

Well, that's the thing. I don't know exactly what happened with it. But you do have a warrant. That's what it's for. My car.
SPEAKER A

Okay. And this happened years ago.
SPEAKER B

I don't know. I have no idea. Man wow.
SPEAKER A

Do you have any idea how sketchy your order needs to be for cops to enforce it reluctantly? Enforcing laws on scared people is one of their favorite things to do. It's that make siren go wee. Woo woo, woo, woo woo and end of list. Now, since then, several of those cases, including all those we just showed you, have been dropped or dismissed. But it really feels like Desantis's main aim there, as in so many cases, was just to instill fear, to make people afraid to protest or to moderate content or even to vote. And that is the thing. Even his sloppily written laws can end up doing real harm. And maybe the clearest place to see all of this in action is in Florida's schools, because he has been very busy there. You probably remember last year's passage of HB 1557, the Florida Parental Rights in Education Act, also known as the don't say Gay bill, though DeSantis says that name pushes a false narrative and has claimed that the bill simply says no sexual instruction to kids prek through three. But the truth is, the bill is not as narrow as that at all, as this DeSantis supporter openly acknowledges.
SPEAKER D

What this bill is trying to prevent is indoctrination of our children.
SPEAKER E

But the bill is a sweeping general piece of legislation that doesn't just apply to young children. It applies throughout the entire school age, where it says age appropriate teaching of gender identity and sexuality.
SPEAKER D

So the bill, it does you're right. It targets kindergarten to third grade, and it says or age appropriate.
SPEAKER E

Yeah. So when is it age appropriate to talk about homosexuality?
SPEAKER D

It varies by the individual.
SPEAKER E

You would sue a teacher if they started talking to your daughter about same sex marriage or LGBTQ issues at the age of 17?
SPEAKER D

If they don't have my consent, and I think it's not appropriate for my daughter, yes.
SPEAKER E

Wow.
SPEAKER B

I think a lot of people would.
SPEAKER E

Be quite shocked to hear that.
SPEAKER D

Well, it's kind of a men's dream. That is the law.
SPEAKER A

Exactly. I know that's rough to hear, but he is technically right there, thanks to Ron DeSantis. Right now it is the law in Florida. And quick side note, it's funny how it's always the people who think homosexuality as a concept needs to be taught at an appropriate age. They don't give a second thought to when they teach their kids what heterosexuality is. Although I could be wrong, maybe in that guy's family. His kid asks every day, who are you people living in my house? And he responds, well, my name is dad, that lady is mom, and we are with friends. Don't ask me any more questions till you're 18 or I will fucking sue you. And it is not just sexuality. Into Santa's Crosshairs, he's also passed an act called the Stop Woke Act, which limits the ways concepts related to systemic racism and sex discrimination can be discussed in schools. And to hear him tell it, laws like that are badly needed because the wokeness in schools goes way deeper than anyone might think.
SPEAKER B

I will have math books sent to my Department of Education for review these textbooks, and they will do things like woke math. And I'm thinking to myself, two plus two equals four. It's not two plus two. Well, let's have a struggle session over that. How do you feel about it? No, there's a right answer here.
SPEAKER A

I mean, out of context, he's completely right there. Numbers don't have feelings. If they did, this one would be sad, this one would be giggly, and this one will be exciting for a few minutes, but then the novelty wears off, and it mostly just gets tired and sore. The Santa had claimed that his state had to reject math books for containing indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially bizarrely for elementary school students. Now, that is a big claim, and if it sounds like bullshit to you, that's because it absolutely is. Reporters for these outlets come through thousands of pages of elementary school textbooks and their reviews and couldn't find any such examples. And when the dissenting administration eventually produced just four tiny snippets of what they claimed was objectionable material, 42 that came from grade school books. There is nothing about race, although one does suggest students practice with empathizing with classmates while they fulfill a lesson objective of identifying numbers from one to five in sequence. That is it. So his big claim of woke math and racistentialism in grade schools is basically regular math and trying to teach kids not to be dicks to each other, a kind of math education that Descents himself, frankly, might have benefited from. As his solution to figuring out the difference between one and three questions seems to be yell until the other person stops talking. And the most recent thing you may have heard about a book's been pulled from shelves in Florida schools with viral images like these making the rounds online now, in classic fashion, DeSantis has pushed back on those images hard.
SPEAKER B

They've tried to create in Florida a narrative. It's basically a book ban hoax. It's a hoax what they're doing. And they're trying to say that because we have parental rights and because we have curriculum transparency, if you have a book that has hardcore pornography in a library that ten year olds can access, a parent objects to that. That does not satisfy Florida standards. It should not be in the library with those young kids, and I think 99% of parents agree with that.
SPEAKER A

Okay, first let's debunk the most egregious claim there, because 99% of parents don't agree on anything. I'm pretty sure you can find at least 10% of parents who are against covering electrical sockets in reach of toddlers. They're called Zap moms, and they're all about letting kids discover their own limits of electricity. But I will give DeSantis this. There has been some misinformation floating around online. This viral list of books that were supposedly banned statewide in Florida circulated widely, but is nonsense. Having said that, those images of empty shelves are very real and are the direct result of Desantis's actions because he signed legislation, mandating, that only approved books could be included in any school or classroom library. And that approval must come from a certified media specialist that led some districts, including the ones those photos are from, to tell teachers to remove or cover books, not because they were pushing a false narrative, but because they were trying to comply with Desantis's stupid law. And while DeSantis might say, well, this isn't overreaction because those books will return once they are approved, not all of them, because thanks to his new law, as well as that don't say gay bill and his Stop Woke act, he has turbocharged the movement among conservatives to get books removed from libraries that they just don't like. And this goes way beyond removing hardcore pornography or the usual kind of give and take between parents and school boards that has been going on for decades now. What DeSantis has done is make it so anyone in a community can challenge these books. Reporters tracked down one woman who submitted 21 book challenges in one county, only to find that she's a retiree with no children who fully admits that she hasn't read all of them, but I've read them impartial. So basically she just skimmed them and said, I'm pretty sure nobody should read this, which is, coincidentally, exactly how I feel about Ronda Santa's new book. But I'm not trying to get it taken out of libraries, am I? Meanwhile, this teacher in the Scambia County, Florida, challenged around 115 books, among them titles like Antango Makes Three, a picture book based on the true story of two male penguins at the Central Park Zoo who raised a baby chick together. Apparently, one of her objections to it is that a second grader could read it and the idea would pop into their mind that these are two people of the same sex that love each other. And the problem is, schools are acting on those sorts of complaints. There was a recent school board meeting in that county to address the calls to ban three of the books on that teacher's list, including the penguin one. Multiple community members came to testify in favor of banning it, and some made it abundantly clear exactly what law they felt empowered them.
SPEAKER F

I probably wouldn't even talk about this book, except for right and wrong is a clear line. And it's not gray, so it is black and white. It's black and white with the law. When we talk about H 1557, we're talking about indoctrination. And when you look up this book on Destiny discover on the schools and county website, the book says this book is about two male penguins that fall in love. Jesus said, Go and sin no more. So this this it's against the law. Thank you.
SPEAKER A

Wow. Just think about the work he had to put into that. That man had to shower, put on a pair of pants, decide what shirt to wear, choose the light blue one that's too size, is too big. Drive to the meeting, park his car, walk into the building, wait a while for his turn to speak. Also, they can eventually stand behind a podium and say out loud as an adult that he's mad about gay penguins. You almost have to admire his dedication to being such a fucking idiot. But the problem is, that fucking idiot won. At that meeting, the board voted to ban Antango Makes Three from its schools. And when you take all of this together, the books being removed, then Inname proclamations to shame trans athletes, these sloppy attempts to criminalize protests, and you combine it with everything else, from the support for restrictive abortion bans to the efforts to stop gender affirming care, it really begins to feel like the freest State in America is only free to the extent that anyone wants to behave exactly the way that Ron DeSantis thinks they should. And look, in the months to come, you're going to hear a lot of DeSantis versus Trump comparisons. And the truth is, he'll probably come out well in a lot of them, more or less by default. But that cannot be the bar here. It is important to consider DeSantis in his own right. If Donald Trump never existed, and let's just all pause and enjoy that hypothetical just for a second. If Donald Trump never existed and you are forced to learn about Ron de Santis from scratch with no basis for comparison, what you would see would justifiably horrify you, because you'd be discovering a petty autocrat and a bully, a man with no interest in hearing dissent questions, or, indeed, the correct pronunciation of Thai food. And all in all, a man who is, and I do not use this term lightly just a fucking meatball. Bye.
