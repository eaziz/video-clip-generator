Ron DeSantis has been all over the news this week. He appointed his political backers to a new Disney oversight board. He released a new book, the courage to be free. Donald Trump has spent weeks trying to get De Santis into a fight, calling him Meatball Ron. This all feels like part of a coordinated rollout of Desantis's inevitable presidential campaign. Since becoming Florida governor, DeSantis has made shutting down dissenting voices something of a feature. He is constantly complaining the media is taking him out of context. Here is a clip from last year in which he shows off his skill at battling the media. DeSantis has signed a bunch of attention grabbing bills that seem designed to delight conservatives and enrage liberals. But the actual implementation of them can get far less scrutiny. Even his sloppily written laws can end up doing real harm. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation mandating that only approved books be included in any school or classroom library. This has turbocharged the movement among conservatives to get books removed from libraries that they just don't like.
